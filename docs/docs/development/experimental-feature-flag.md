# Experimental Feature Flags

### Introduction

This document provides details about the feature flags used in our project and their current status. Feature flags are a technique that allows us to enable or disable functionalities in a controlled and gradual manner. This enables us to test and deploy features independently and reduce the impact of changes.

### Conventions

* **Feature Flag Name:** Descriptive name of the feature flag.
* **Description:** Brief description of the functionality enabled or disabled by the feature flag.
* **Status:** Current status of the feature flag (enabled or disabled).
* **Activation Date:** Date on which the feature flag was activated.
* **Context:** Context in which the feature flag is used.
* **Affected Users:** Approximate number of users or user segments affected by the feature flag.


## List of Experimental Feature Flags

Below is the list of feature flags used in the project:

### `[Feature Flag Name]`
